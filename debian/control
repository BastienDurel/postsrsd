Description: Sender Rewriting Scheme implementation for Postfix
 Implements two TCP lookup tables to rewrite mail addresses
 as needed. The forward SRS is for sender envelope addresses
 to prevent SPF-related bounces. The reverse SRS is for
 recipient envelope addresses so that bounced mails can be
 routed back to their original sender.
